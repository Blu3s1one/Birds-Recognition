# Birds Recognition
 This Github contains all codes and data used and created for our 3rd Semester Project at __IMT Atlantique__. This project answers to a request of __Lorient Agglomeration__, that is to test if Machine Learning can be used in order to help the study of birds in a mudflat.
 
## Classification
It is the part of the project that aims at identifying the species of a bird on a photo. You will find 2 folders in it. One contains the code that we used to do classification with __YOLO__, and the other contains the code and Data used with __Resnet_18__. You will also find the code that we used for __Data_Augmentation__.

## Detection
It is the part of the project that aims at __detecting birds__ on a picture, and create __boxes__, each one containing one bird. We used __SSD-Resnet50__ for this part.

## Researches
This folder contains the 3 docs that sum up our work for __Lorient Agglom√©rarion__. The purpose was to test if __Deep Learning methods__ could be useful in order to help the __study of birds__ in a mudflat.

## Web_Scraping
This contains the __tutorial__ to follow in order to __get images from the internet__ with Web_Scraping.

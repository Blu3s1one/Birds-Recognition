# Birds Recognition
 This Github contains all codes and data used and created for our 3rd Semester Project at IMT Atlantique. This project answers to a request of Lorient Agglomeration, that is to test if Machine Learning can be used in order to help the study of birds in a mudflat.
 
# Classification
It is the part of the project that aims at identifying the species of a bird on a photo. You will find 2 folders in it. One contains the code that we used to do classification with YOLO, and the other contains the code and Data used with Resnet_18. You will also find the code that we used for Data_Augmentation.

# Detection
It is the part of the project that aims at detecting birds on a picture, and create boxes, each one containing one bird.

# Researches
This folder contains the 3 docs that sum up our work for Lorient Agglomérarion. The purpose was to test if Deep Learning methods could be useful in order to help the study of birds in a mudflat.
